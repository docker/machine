# create

Create a machine.  Requires the `--driver` flag to indicate which provider
(VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.) the machine should be created on, and an
argument to indicate the name of the created machine.

## Accessing driver-specific flags in the help text

The `docker-machine create` command has some flags which are applicable to all
drivers.  These largely control aspects of Machine's provisoning process
(including the creation of Docker Swarm containers) that the user may wish to
customize.

    $ docker-machine create
    Docker Machine Version: 0.5.0 (45e3688)
    Usage: docker-machine create [OPTIONS] [arg...]

    Create a machine.

    Run 'docker-machine create --driver name' to include the create flags for that driver in the help text.

    Options:

       --driver, -d "none"                                                                                  Driver to create machine with.

       --engine-env [--engine-env option --engine-env option]                                               Specify environment variables to set in the engine
       --swarm                                                                                              Configure Machine with Swarm

       --swarm-master                                                                                       Configure Machine to be a Swarm master
       --swarm-discovery                                                                                    Discovery service to use with Swarm
       --swarm-strategy "spread"                                                                            Define a default scheduling strategy for Swarm
       --swarm-opt [--swarm-opt option --swarm-opt option]                                                  Define arbitrary flags for swarm
       --swarm-host "tcp://0.0.0.0:3376"                                                                    ip/socket to listen on for Swarm master
       --swarm-addr                                                                                         addr to advertise for Swarm (default: detect and use the machine IP)
       --swarm-experimental                                                                                 Enable Swarm experimental features

Additionally, drivers can specify flags that Machine can accept as part of their
plugin code.  These allow users to customize the provider-specific parameters of
the created machine, such as size (`--amazonec2-instance-type m1.medium`),
geographical region (`--amazonec2-region us-west-1`), and so on.

To see the provider-specific flags, simply pass a value for `--driver` when
invoking the `create` help text.

You may notice that some flags specify environment variables that they are
associated with as well (located to the far left hand side of the row).  If
these environment variables are set when `docker-machine create` is invoked,
Docker Machine will use them for the default value of the flag.

## Specifying configuration options for the created Docker engine

As part of the process of creation, Docker Machine installs Docker and
configures it with some sensible defaults. For instance, it allows connection
from the outside world over TCP with TLS-based encryption and defaults to AUFS
as the [storage
driver](/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd.md#daemon-storage-driver-option)
when available.

There are several cases where the user might want to set options for the created
Docker engine (also known as the Docker _daemon_) themselves. For example, they
may want to allow connection to a [registry](/registry/index.md)
that they are running themselves using the `--insecure-registry` flag for the
daemon. Docker Machine supports the configuration of such options for the
created engines via the `create` command flags which begin with `--engine`.

Note that Docker Machine simply sets the configured parameters on the daemon
and does not set up any of the "dependencies" for you. For instance, if you
specify that the created daemon should use `btrfs` as a storage driver, you
still must ensure that the proper dependencies are installed, the BTRFS
filesystem has been created, and so on.

The following is an example usage:

    $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \
        --engine-label foo=bar \
        --engine-label spam=eggs \
        --engine-storage-driver overlay \
        --engine-insecure-registry registry.myco.com \
        foobarmachine

This will create a virtual machine running locally in Virtualbox which uses the
`overlay` storage backend, has the key-value pairs `foo=bar` and `spam=eggs` as
labels on the engine, and allows pushing / pulling from the insecure registry
located at `registry.myco.com`. You can verify much of this by inspecting the
output of `docker info`:

    $ eval $(docker-machine env foobarmachine)
    $ docker info
    Containers: 0
    Images: 0
    Storage Driver: overlay
    ...
    Name: foobarmachine
    ...
    Labels:
     foo=bar
     spam=eggs
     provider=virtualbox

The supported flags are as follows:

-   `--engine-insecure-registry`: Specify [insecure registries](/engine/reference/commandline/cli.md#insecure-registries) to allow with the created engine
-   `--engine-registry-mirror`: Specify [registry mirrors](/registry/recipes/mirror.md) to use
-   `--engine-label`: Specify [labels](/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata.md#daemon-labels) for the created engine
-   `--engine-storage-driver`: Specify a [storage driver](/engine/reference/commandline/cli.md#daemon-storage-driver-option) to use with the engine

If the engine supports specifying the flag multiple times (such as with
`--label`), then so does Docker Machine.

In addition to this subset of daemon flags which are directly supported, Docker
Machine also supports an additional flag, `--engine-opt`, which can be used to
specify arbitrary daemon options with the syntax `--engine-opt flagname=value`.
For example, to specify that the daemon should use `8.8.8.8` as the DNS server
for all containers, and always use the `syslog` [log
driver](/engine/reference/run.md#logging-drivers-log-driver) you
could run the following create command:

    $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \
        --engine-opt dns=8.8.8.8 \
        --engine-opt log-driver=syslog \
        gdns

Additionally, Docker Machine supports a flag, `--engine-env`, which can be used to
specify arbitrary environment variables to be set within the engine with the syntax `--engine-env name=value`. For example, to specify that the engine should use `example.com` as the proxy server, you could run the following create command:

    $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \
        --engine-env HTTP_PROXY=http://example.com:8080 \
        --engine-env HTTPS_PROXY=https://example.com:8080 \
        --engine-env NO_PROXY=example2.com \
        proxbox

## Specifying Docker Swarm options for the created machine

In addition to being able to configure Docker Engine options as listed above,
you can use Machine to specify how the created Swarm master should be
configured. There is a `--swarm-strategy` flag, which you can use to specify
the [scheduling strategy](/swarm/scheduler/strategy.md)
which Docker Swarm should use (Machine defaults to the `spread` strategy).
There is also a general purpose `--swarm-opt` option which works similar to how
the aforementioned `--engine-opt` option does, except that it specifies options
for the `swarm manage` command (used to boot a master node) instead of the base
command. You can use this to configure features that power users might be
interested in, such as configuring the heartbeat interval or Swarm's willingness
to over-commit resources. There is also the `--swarm-experimental` flag, that
allows you to access [experimental features](https://github.com/docker/swarm/tree/master/experimental)
in Docker Swarm.

If you're not sure how to configure these options, it is best to not specify
configuration at all. Docker Machine will choose sensible defaults for you and
you won't have to worry about it.

Example create:

    $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \
        --swarm \
        --swarm-master \
        --swarm-discovery token://<token> \
        --swarm-strategy binpack \
        --swarm-opt heartbeat=5 \
        upbeat

This will set the swarm scheduling strategy to "binpack" (pack in containers as
tightly as possible per host instead of spreading them out), and the "heartbeat"
interval to 5 seconds.

## Pre-create check

Since many drivers require a certain set of conditions to be in place before
they can successfully perform a create (e.g. VirtualBox should be installed, or
the provided API credentials should be valid), Docker Machine has a "pre-create
check" which is specified at the driver level.

If this pre-create check succeeds, Docker Machine will proceed with the creation
as normal.  If the pre-create check fails, the Docker Machine process will exit
with status code 3 to indicate that the source of the non-zero exit was the
pre-create check failing.
