# Migrate from Boot2Docker to Docker Machine

If you were using Boot2Docker previously, you have a pre-existing Docker
`boot2docker-vm` VM on your local system.  To allow Docker Machine to manage
this older VM, you must migrate it.

1. Open a terminal or the Docker CLI on your system.

2. Type the following command.

        $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-import-boot2docker-vm boot2docker-vm docker-vm
      
3. Use the `docker-machine` command to interact with the migrated VM.  

## Subcommand comparison
      
The `docker-machine` subcommands are slightly different than the `boot2docker`
subcommands. The table below lists the equivalent `docker-machine` subcommand
and what it does:

|  `boot2docker` | `docker-machine` | `docker-machine` description                             |
