# govmomi

A Go library for interacting with VMware vSphere APIs (ESXi and/or vCenter).

For `govc`, a CLI built on top of govmomi, check out the [govc](./govc) directory.

## Compatibility

This library is built for and tested against ESXi and vCenter 5.5.

If you're able to use it against older versions of ESXi and/or vCenter, please
leave a note and we'll include it in this compatibility list.

## Documentation

The APIs exposed by this library very closely follow the API described in the [VMware vSphere API Reference Documentation][apiref].
Refer to this document to become familiar with the upstream API.

The code in the `govmomi` package is a wrapper for the code that is generated from the vSphere API description.
It primarily provides convenience functions for working with the vSphere API.
See [godoc.org][godoc] for documentation.
