## Installation

If you're a Mac or Windows user, the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox) will install Docker Machine {{VERSION}} for you, alongside the latest versions of the Docker Engine, Compose and Kitematic.

You can use the usual commands to install or upgrade:

On OS X or Linux
```console
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/{{VERSION}}/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
```
On Windows with git bash
```console
$ if [[ ! -d "$HOME/bin" ]]; then mkdir -p "$HOME/bin"; fi && \
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.6.0/docker-machine-Windows-x86_64.exe > "$HOME/bin/docker-machine.exe" && \
chmod +x "$HOME/bin/docker-machine.exe"
```

Otherwise, download one of the releases from the [release page](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/) directly.

See the install [docs](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) for more install options and instructions.
