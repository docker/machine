go-xenserver-client
===================

This is the beginnings of a golang client library for XenAPI. 


Disclaimer!
-----------
Please note that this library is currently **experimental** and only
enables a limited subset of XenAPI's interface.

As with any early beginnings of a project, the interfaces are also subject to 
change, so please beware!

And of course, contributions are most welcome!
